🧬 ALD Foundation Model: Synthetic Data Pretraining Pipeline

ALD-FM is an open research project to build a foundation model for Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and related lipidomics disorders.
It focuses on scalable synthetic data generation and representation learning from high-dimensional biochemical tables.

🚀 Project Overview

Modern foundation models need millions of samples — but ALD datasets are small and sparse.
This project builds a synthetic data engine that expands real lipidomics datasets into a massive, biologically consistent corpus for pretraining.

Pipeline highlights:

🧩 Canonical dataset construction

🧠 Multi-model synthetic data generation

⚙️ Quality control & evaluation

🧬 Foundation model pretraining

🔎 Fine-tuning for ALD-specific prediction & causal inference
